# Sentinel-2 Optical Pipeline
> A Sentinel-2 remote sensing pipeline for generating RGB imagery and water-related spectral indices (NDVI, NDWI, MNDWI) from Copernicus Data Space imagery.

A Python pipeline for **remote sensing and satellite imagery processing** that generates RGB composites and spectral indices (NDVI, NDWI, MNDWI) from **Sentinel-2 Level-2A imagery** using the **Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (STAC API + S3 access)**.

This repository provides a **reproducible geospatial workflow** for downloading, processing, and exporting Sentinel-2 optical data for applications such as:

- satellite remote sensing analysis  
- SAR validation and comparison  
- flood monitoring and water detection  
- vegetation monitoring using NDVI  
- optical reference generation for SAR studies  

⚠️ **This repository does NOT contain Sentinel-2 imagery.**  
All data must be downloaded directly from the **Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem**.



## Overview

This pipeline automates a typical **Sentinel-2 remote sensing workflow**:

1. **STAC search** with cloud filtering and date constraints  
2. **Band download via S3 API**  
3. **RGB composite generation** (TCI or B02/B03/B04)  
4. **Spectral index computation**
   - NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)
   - NDWI (McFeeters Water Index)
   - MNDWI (Modified NDWI)
5. **SCL masking** (cloud, shadow, snow filtering)
6. Export to **GeoTIFF (GTiff)** and **PNG quicklooks**

The workflow is designed for **geospatial analysis, satellite data processing, and remote sensing research**.



## Data Source

- **Sentinel-2 Level-2A (Surface Reflectance)**
- Accessed via the **Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem**
- Search performed via **STAC API**
- Data download via **S3 protocol**

This repository **does not redistribute Sentinel-2 data**.

When publishing derived products, follow the **Copernicus / Sentinel attribution guidelines** required by your journal or institution.

## Required bands

| Product | Bands Used |
|--------|------------|
| RGB | B02, B03, B04 (10 m) |
| NDVI | B08 (10 m), B04 (10 m) |
| NDWI | B03 (10 m), B08 (10 m) |
| MNDWI | B03 (10 m), B11 (20 m → resampled) |
| Mask | SCL (20 m → nearest resampled) |

All outputs are standardized to **10 m** resolution.



## Notes

- 20 m layers (B11, SCL) are read on the 10 m reference grid (B03_10m) using on-the-fly resampling.
- Bilinear resampling is used for continuous reflectance bands (e.g., B11).
- Nearest-neighbor resampling is used for categorical layers (SCL).
- Pixels flagged as cloud/shadow/snow/invalid in SCL are masked (set to NaN).
- Indices are exported as float32 GeoTIFF (GTiff) and PNG quicklooks.



## Requirements  
  
- Python: 3.10+  
- Conda: Miniconda/Anaconda recommended (use conda-forge)  
- Environments:  
- `s2api`: STAC search + S3 download  
- `s2viz`: processing + visualization (GDAL/Rasterio stack)  
  
All dependencies are pinned in `environment_*.yml` (single source of truth).



## Setup

Create environment:

conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate s2viz

Create a `.env` file:

CDSE_S3_ACCESS_KEY=your_key
CDSE_S3_SECRET_KEY=your_secret



## Workflow

### 1) Scene selection

python s2_stac_pick_cloudfree.py

### 2) Download required bands

python s2_s3_download_rgb.py

### 3) Generate RGB composite

python s2_make_rgb.py

### 4) Compute spectral indices

python s2_make_indices.py

Outputs are written to:

downloads/S2_INDICES/



## Intended use: SAR validation (optical reference)

These Sentinel-2 products are intended as *optical reference layers* to support SAR-based analysis (e.g., MicroSAR / small-SAR satellite studies), for example:

- Qualitative comparison of SAR-derived water masks vs. optical water proxies (NDWI/MNDWI)
- Seasonal context layers for SAR acquisitions (vegetation state via NDVI)
- Cloud-contamination screening using SCL (to avoid misinterpreting optical indices)

**Important:** spectral indices are not absolute ground truth for water.
They can be biased by turbidity, algae blooms, sunglint, terrain shadows, mixed pixels, and adjacency effects.
